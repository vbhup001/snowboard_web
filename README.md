# snowboard_web
First demo webpage created from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 4.

Features I implemented in this webpage include:
  - Navbar with drop-down options
  - Auto-rotating picture carousel
  - Clickable buttons and forms
  - Embedded YouTube video modals
  - Social media hyperlinked footer
  - Mobile responsiveness to entire webpage
  
I really enjoyed this project and I am working on more small webpages and learning how to use more current libraries such as React.js.

I do not own any of the pictures or videos displayed on this webpage. All credits go to the respective owners.
